// Documentation for these models can be found in the "models" package as these
// are just protobuf representations of those models.
//
// Why represent what amounts to the same model twice in protobuf AND a struct
// you ask?
//
//   Essentially, because the separation of the transport layer and the
//   application layer is a good thing. There are probably many reasons, but
//   the most straightforward is that we might want to represent something in
//   the database or within the application that might not be easily
//   representable in protobuf, a structure mainly made for transport.
//
//   There might also be things that we don't want to expose outside and so
//   the separation gives us a chance to not mess that up by simply forgetting a
//   json:"-".
